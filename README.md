# HealerHub
## Collaborative Guides by the World of Warcraft Community

Welcome to the HealerHub repository, this is where we keep the entire site. We hope
to have the most up to date guides about healing on the internet. This is where
you can find out more about our ethos and how we maintain quality guides.

## Feature Rich

The site is built upon an extremely dynamic, performant framework that allows us to
offer tooltips and other various information at speeds other websites simply
cannot manage. As well as this, we can iterate on and tailor our experience at a rapid pace using modern development techniques which other, more hefty sites such as 
WoWHead or WoWDB cannot (or will not) be able to do.

## Authoritative

HealerHub isn't driven by ads, clicks, "premium", or other financial incentives that
risk the integrity and accuracy of the guides. Any new content is met with peer review
that will ensure each piece of content is high quality and accurate.
