# Talent Choices

Discipline has a lot of versatile choices in Battle for Azeroth, a retuning of the abilities
has left us in a very strong position to choose based on the situation. Below you can find
some recommendations on which abilities to choose.

<Spell id=214621></Spell> is a very strong choice, enabling you to choose when you want to benefit from this tier's bonus. As Discipline can still pull off very strong burst, this is very advantageous.

## Talent Recommendations

Twist of Fate and Schism are very strong choices, Twist of Fate being the choice for Mythic
raiders in Legion for progress environments may not repeat itself due to the increased breakdown
of absorbs in Battle for Azeroth.

The buffs to Schism have left it in a very strong position as a burst cooldown that synchronizes
well with Evangelism, as well as giving a huge boost to DPS. This is very welcome in a world with
no Light's Wrath.

Castigation has fallen by the wayside, as Penance has seen a very significant power decrease, the
extra bolt just seems to not be doing much in beta logs. It may become a choice pick for fights
where Contrition is strong, but Twist of Fate won't proc.

Angelic Feather is realistically the only ability you will take here, the mobility is amazing on a
specialisation that is very slow otherwise. Masochism may see niche use on fights where Desperate
Prayer alone won't help, however isn't recommended.

::: tip
Use the macro below to share a bind with Angelic Feather and a self-cast Shadow Mend, it will even
cast the Angelic Feather on you!

```

/cast [talent:2/1,@player] Angelic Feather

Power Word: Solace strikes a nice balance between it's peers, not the best for mana return and not
the best for burst DPS. It's available for some strong synergy with Schism as the cooldown is half that
of Schism.

Shield Discipline is low in raw output, but it gives you a lot more mana to do with what you please. This
is the strongest talent on the tier for mana by far, however you lose a significant amount of output for that
benefit. Shield Discipline will work well if you have to use Power Word: Shield a lot, but it's recommended
that you try to focus on burst windows and choose one of the alternatives on this row.

Mindbender is incredibly strong in Battle for Azeroth, it is the strongest output on the tier but gives
the lowest amount of mana. This works well for Mindbender as your situation for choosing it is for strong burst
healing in minute intervals, meaning mana expenditure between ramps will not be high.

When was the last time you cast Psychic Scream or Mind Control? Thought so - take Shining Force.

Lenience is as always, a huge amount of mitigation for your raid. This talent is strong, however if you are
having trouble judging how strong, remember that [WoWAnalyzer](www.wowanalyzer.com) can tell you how much
it does. Typically, if the fight follows an archetype where people are taking huge amounts of damage, consistently,
Lenience is your choice.

Orison is a strong pick for the situations that Lenience and Contrition don't work well. Don't fall into the trap
of thinking this synergises well with Shield Discipline though - Orison just makes Power Word: Shield into a
cheaper Shadow Mend. Thanks to Atonement opportunity cost, it is never worth spamming Power Word: Shield.

Contrition is a strong pick when you need to do strong spot healing and strong Atonement healing at the same time,
the AoE effect is just as strong as an offensive Penance. This talent has the potential for monstrous numbers, but
at the same time it excludes you from several beneficial effects, such as:
* Power of the Dark Side
* Purge the Wicked Synergy
* Schism synergy
* Having a nice amount of DPS

Your group healing will likely be weaker with this talent than without *on average*, but the ability to heal the tank
and the group at the same time is amazingly strong in the right conditions.

Purge the Wicked is still very strong, but no longer reigns as king in situations where you cannot benefit from the spread.
If you can reliably spread this, it contains an amazing amount of value that will be hard for Divine Star or Halo to beat.

Divine Star is very strong in stack situations when the healing can be made use of every 15s. Interestingly the Atonement
component of Divine Star is very minor, meaning that there's no pressure to have a lot of Atonement out whilst casting it. It
will do a significant amount more healing than Halo if you can manage it right.

Halo is a big boy now, arguably the default choice for raiders on single target fights. It deals a huge amount of damage, and
also does a huge amount of raw healing that *is* buffed by Reverence.

Luminous Barrier replaces Power Word: Barrier, but gives you a massive absorb shield instead. This seems good but you will be
able to squeeze more value out of having Barrier and Evangelism. Taking this in anything other than a raid is a mistake. If
you cannot make Power Word: Barrier work, or you have trouble utilising it, Luminous Barrier may be a good pick.

Grace is good for dungeons and maybe some fights where spot healing is at a premium. Note that **grace does not buff Contrition!**

Evangelism is a standard pick, the ability to extend your Atonements and cast more of your cooldowns into them counters
a lot of intense healing phases. This cooldown is a little weaker now that we no longer have access to Velen's.
